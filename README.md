# Finance-and-Supply-chain-Analytics

Project Description:

As the size of our Excel files continues to grow, we are encountering performance issues, causing them to become unresponsive and inefficient. To address this challenge, AtliQ Hardware has initiated a project to incorporate a team of data analysts who will use MySQL as their database management system and to extract valuable insights from the data. These insights will empower our company to make more informed and strategic decisions, ultimately optimizing our operations and performance.

I learned the following things in this project -

➡️ SQL Query Fundamentals:
i. Retrieve data using text (select, in, where, like) and numeric queries (between, in, orderby, limit, offset).
ii. Perform summary analytics (min, max, avg, groupby, having).
iii. Create calculated columns.
➡️ Joins:
Understand different join types - left, right, inner, full outer join. ➡️ Advanced SQL Concepts:
i. Work with subqueries, ANY & ALL Operators, and Common Table Expressions (CTE's).
ii. Explore data normalization and data integrity, including Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD).
iii. Understand various data types such as string, numeric, date, JSON, spatial, and grasp primary key and foreign key concepts.
iv. Learned Data Definition Language (DDL) commands.
➡️ Data Warehousing:
i.Differentiate between OLAP and OLTP databases, and understand snowflake and star schema.
➡️ Advanced Database Objects:
i. Create user-defined functions, stored procedures, and views.
➡️ Window Functions:
i. Utilize window functions like rank, dense rank, row number, and others. ➡️ Business Knowledge:
i. Apply SQL skills to financial domains, including profit and loss statements i.e the road from gross sales to net profit and incorporate KANBAN learnings in work culture.
12. Gain insights into supply chain domain knowledge, covering net error, absolute error, and forecast accuracy.
